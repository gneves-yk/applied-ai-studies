# 🧠 applied-ai-studies  

A personal space where I document my journey learning **Applied Artificial Intelligence**.  
Here I explore different AI concepts and techniques through **hands-on projects**, **Jupyter notebooks**, and **small experiments**.  

This repository is **a work in progress**, and I’ll keep expanding it as I learn and experiment with new topics in AI.  


### 📚 Focus areas  
- Practical applications of AI in real-world problems  


### ⚙️ Tools  
- Python  
- Jupyter Notebook  
- Popular AI/ML libraries (TensorFlow, PyTorch, Scikit-learn, etc.)


### 🚧 Status  
This repository is currently **under development** — I’m continuously updating it as I learn new concepts and build more experiments.
